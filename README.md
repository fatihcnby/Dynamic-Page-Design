<h1> Dynamic-Page-Design </h1>

I have designed a page where you can choose from different product types according to the features. 

You can select the products and browse the details. The page has a completely dynamic structure. Product information can be changed easily.

I made the page design with Html5 and Bootstrap. I coded the product selection and information transfer with Javascript.
